# Jumpscare Jam Submission

**Overview**
This project was my entry for the Jumpscare Jam, an event I conceived and hosted. The 24-hour jam began merely three hours after being conceived and featured five participating teams.

**Challenge and Implementation**
I opted to use only the core functionalities of Pygame, avoiding external assets (like textures or sounds). All graphics, animations, and sounds were created using code.

The game's soundtrack, originally a 33.5 MB file, was converted into a compact data string of about 19.5-38 KB by a small compression algorithm which I created for this Jam. During gameplay it's processed on a separate thread at game start.

**Gameplay Experience**
Here is a short gameplay video (note: please adjust your volume as the audio is intense):
